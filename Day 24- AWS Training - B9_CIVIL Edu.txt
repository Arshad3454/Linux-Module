Identity and Access Management (IAM)
================================
~ FREE for lifelong
~ Authentication, Accessibility
~ Authentication is nothing the Identity. To provide Authentication to AWS Account, Identity is important.
~ To get access to AWS Services, an User has to create AWS Account, from which Username and Password can be generated.
~ To further secure your AWS Account, we have a feature which is called as MFA (Multi Factor Authentication)
~ But in AWS, identity is just to log-in to the AWS Account. To use the services in AWS we need Access which is called as Autherization.
~ The username and password in AWS are called as Root Credentials and the user who is having the username and password is called as Root User.
~ There are two types of users in AWS: 1. Root User 2. IAM User
~ AWS suggests to use only IAM User instead of Root User.
